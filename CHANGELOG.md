# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html): before 1.0, a breaking change to a tool
name or schema, the store format, the manifest format, the config key or the plugin name bumps the
minor version (plan 04 §4.4; plan 09 K6). One version covers the server, the Skills and the plugin.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Scaffold and supply chain (plan 04 §1–§2).** `.npmrc` (`ignore-scripts`, `save-exact`,
  `engine-strict`, `audit`), `.nvmrc` (Node 24.21.0; engines `>=24.15`), `package.json` with exactly
  four runtime dependencies pinned exactly — `@modelcontextprotocol/server` 2.2.0, `zod` 4.6.5 (the
  one zod the SDK resolves), `hyparquet` 1.31.2, `@napi-rs/keyring` 2.1.0 — and a committed
  lockfile; runtime tree of 6 packages held exactly by `scripts/ci/runtime-allowlist.json`.
- **TypeScript, lint, format, tests (plan 04 §3, plan 05 §1, §7).** Strict `tsconfig` (NodeNext,
  ES2023, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`);
  ESLint flat config with typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked`, the plan 01 §1.1 layer table, the
  two ESPN zones (only `src/auth/keychain.ts` may import `@napi-rs/keyring`; only
  `src/providers/espn/` may import the wire schemas in `views/`), and bans on `eval`,
  `new Function`, shell-string `exec`; Prettier and EditorConfig; Vitest projects `unit` and
  `process` with the plan 05 §7 coverage gate (global 90/85/90/90, eleven 100 % entries as globs).
- **Secret and identifier protection (plan 04 §4.1 R11, §4.3; `CLAUDE.md`).**
  `scripts/dev/scan-secrets.mjs` with ESPN rules (named and bare `espn_s2`, SWID and brace-GUIDs
  outside the fixture range, league-id shapes, Cookie headers, `clientAddress`, IPv4, home paths,
  email) and a local deny-list that is never printed; `scripts/dev/commit-paths.sh` (private
  index, refuses `main`, scans blobs and message, GitHub no-reply identity only, pushes);
  `.githooks/pre-commit` and `.githooks/commit-msg`; `.gitleaks.toml` with the ESPN rules;
  generated (never committed) self-test fixtures in `scripts/ci/secret-fixtures.mjs`.
- **CI (plan 04 §4).** `ci.yml` (lint incl. commit messages, typecheck, test + coverage gate,
  supply-chain: `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`, no install scripts, licenses, full
  runtime tree; pack scan; process), `docs.yml` (Mermaid render with pinned mermaid-cli and an
  explicit `chrome-headless-shell` install, internal links, identifiers, plugin + Skills
  structure and `claude plugin validate --strict`), `secrets.yml` (gitleaks pinned by version and
  sha256 over the full history and the tree, plus its self-test), Dependabot (monthly, grouped) and
  a pull-request template. Every action pinned by commit SHA; `contents: read`; no secrets.
- **Plugin root (plan 09 §4, K8).** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (`espn-fantasy-football`,
  `userConfig` for the league id and season) and `marketplace.json` (the repo is its own
  marketplace), `.mcp.json` launching `/bin/sh scripts/eff-launch.sh serve` with no
  `EFF_CONFIG_DIR`/`EFF_CACHE_DIR`, and the POSIX launch shim that resolves a Node >= 24.15 in a
  fixed order and prints the exact fix when none is found.
