## Output contract (every recommendation)

Render every recommendation under these headings, in this order, on about one screen — tables over prose. **A recommendation without an interval is a failed recommendation**: if a tool gave no interval, say the call cannot be made yet and why.

### Recommendation
The action in ESPN's vocabulary (slot names `QB RB WR TE FLEX D/ST K BE IR`; the page the user will act on), each player as his quoted name with his `player_id`. When `rec.no_move` is true, say **"No move"** and why.

### Numbers
- The point estimate and **p10 / p50 / p90**, with the distribution's `basis` named ("position-level spread" for `position_cv`, "player simulation" for `player_sim`).
- Δ versus the next-best option with its interval (`rec.delta_vs_next` value, p10–p90) and the decision metric named (`rec.decision_metric`).
- ESPN's number beside ours, labelled as ESPN's (`projected_espn`, `projection_week_espn`, `win_probability_espn`, `playoff_pct_espn`).
- A win-probability change reported as `sign_and_band` (`p_win_reporting`) is given as its band ("a small gain in win chance"), never turned into a precise number.
- A Δ interval that includes 0 is "no move" — a coin flip — never a dramatised edge.

### Why
The ranked `rec.drivers[]`, strongest first, in plain words.

### What would change my mind
Each `rec.assumptions[]` with its `revisit_trigger`; the invalidators ("if X is ruled out before his kickoff, start Y instead"); the `flip_driver` when the tool gives one.

### Confidence & freshness
The role sample size (`rec.confidence.role_games`); every input's `as_of` / `age_s` (from `data.inputs[]`); every input whose `freshness` is `stale` named; "n too small" wherever the tool says so; every `warnings[]` entry repeated in plain words (an injection flag in one line). A result with `partial: true` lacks an input its warning names: say so and what it leaves out, and give its number only after the one repeat call references/tool-outputs.md prescribes — never as the final answer.

### Deadline
`rec.latest_execution_time` or the earliest `lock_at` that matters, in Eastern Time; for waivers, `next_run_at` (from `rules.waiver.next_execution`). Every action carries one.

### Log
The `log_id` returned by `espn_record_recommendation` — recorded **before** this answer was shown — or "not logged" and why (references/log.md).

### Attribution
"League data and ESPN projections from ESPN Fantasy (unofficial API); nflverse CC-BY-4.0" — printing only the sources whose `meta.attribution[]` actually appears in the results used. Our projections and probabilities are this server's estimates (`meta.estimate: true`), never a consensus or ESPN's.

End with "say *apply* for the exact clicks" while `capabilities.write` is false.
